# Ports Wordle

Ports Wordle is a fun and educational word-guessing game inspired by the popular Wordle game, but with a focus on port and shipping-related terms. This game is designed to be easily embedded into any website.

## Features

- Single-file implementation for easy embedding
- Browser-based game with a clean, responsive interface
- Randomly selected words from a curated list of port and shipping terms
- Six attempts to guess the correct word
- Visual feedback on guessed letters
- On-screen keyboard and physical keyboard support

## How to Play

1. Guess the hidden 5-letter word related to ports and shipping.
2. Type your guess using the on-screen keyboard or your physical keyboard.
3. Press "Enter" to submit your guess.
4. The tiles will change color to provide feedback:
   - Green: Correct letter in the correct position
   - Yellow: Correct letter in the wrong position
   - Gray: Incorrect letter
5. You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly.
6. Use the "Delete" button to remove the last letter of your current guess.

## Installation

No installation is required. The entire game is contained in a single HTML file (`index.html`). To use it:

1. Copy the contents of `index.html`.
2. Paste it directly into your website's HTML, or use a code block if your platform supports it (e.g., WordPress).

Example for WordPress:

1. In your WordPress editor, add a "Custom HTML" block.
2. Paste the entire contents of `index.html` into this block.
3. Update or publish your page.

The game will now be embedded and playable directly on your website.

## Customization

You can easily customize the word list by modifying the `words` array in the JavaScript section of the HTML file.
